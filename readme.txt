This plugin allows you to define the price experiments for any product.

== Description ==
SegmentLab Extension allows to easily experiment with WooCommerce product prices. Different prices and pricing techniques let you understand which pricing model brings the most revenue and sales from your customers.

== Extension Services ==

**Easily experiment with prices**
On Wordpress WooCommerce platform SegmentLab lets you run different price and pricing techniques experiments, so you can understand which pricing model brings the most revenue and engagement from your audience.

**Price Testing**
Once you have our WooCommerce plugin installed you can easily test multiple price levels where each products can be offered at different prices for individual customers.

**Rounded vs Non-Rounded Pricing**
Ever wondered which pricing technique is right for your project. Should you do round pricing, maybe $.95 would work better? What about $.99 or $.97? With SegmentLab you can easily test all these and other pricing techniques. Stop guessing and start testing!

== How it works ==
From the moment when customers first come to your shop they get randomly assigned a price from a price testing experiment that you’ve set up. Testing prices appear across the store like for any other product, in the main shop page, category pages, cart, checkout page and remain the same for repeat visits of a particular visitor.
 
SegmentLab Platform also provides an option for more experienced users to setup your own Multi Variant Split tests and track their performance between different users. This option allows to optimize your website for each visitor by displaying a version of the site that will provide the best experience and engagement for the user currently visiting the site.
